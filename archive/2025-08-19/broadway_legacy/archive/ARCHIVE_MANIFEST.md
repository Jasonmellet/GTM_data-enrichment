# Broadway Project Archive - August 18, 2025

## 🗂️ What Was Archived

**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Reason**: Starting fresh with clean architecture  
**Status**: All files moved to archive for reference

## 📁 Archived Contents

### Scripts (61 files)
- All pipeline scripts (`full_pipeline.py`, `full_enrichment_pipeline.py`, etc.)
- All utility scripts (`check_contact_enrichment.py`, `create_*.py`, etc.)
- All enrichment modules (`Broadway_site_crawler_module.py`, etc.)
- All database scripts (`db_*.py`, etc.)

### Documentation
- All markdown files and documentation
- Roadmaps and guides
- API documentation

### Outputs
- All CSV reports and exports
- All summary reports
- All test outputs and data files

## 🚨 Why We Started Over

1. **Overcomplicated Architecture**: Multiple conflicting pipeline scripts
2. **Broken Dependencies**: Scripts calling each other in confusing ways
3. **Column Reference Issues**: "Contact id" vs "org_id", "Website URL" vs "website_domain"
4. **No Clear Data Flow**: Everything was tangled together
5. **Fixing Symptoms, Not Root Causes**: Constant patching instead of proper design

## 🎯 New Approach

**"Create small modules to do specific tasks, once finalized we then create one pipeline script to rule them all"**

### New Clean Architecture:
1. **Individual Task Modules**: Each doing one thing well
2. **One Master Pipeline**: Orchestrating all modules
3. **Simple Data Flow**: Linear, predictable, testable
4. **Build & Test**: One module at a time until perfect

## 📋 Next Steps

1. ✅ Archive everything (COMPLETED)
2. 🔄 Start fresh with clean architecture
3. 🧪 Build one module at a time
4. ✅ Test each module individually
5. 🚀 Create one master pipeline
6. 🎯 Test the complete system
